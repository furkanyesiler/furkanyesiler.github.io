## Talks & Tutorials

#### Contrastive learning: An introduction to supervised and self-supervised approaches.
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">F. Yesiler</span>
<!--<br/><span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract**: Contrastive learning is a learning paradigm where the training process is guided using the similarity relationships between items. This talk aims to give a high-level introduction to supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning approaches. We will start with motivating the use of contrastive methods for discriminative tasks and representation learning. We will then go through the supervised metric learning approaches and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using pairs, triplets, and proxies. We will continue with introducing several self-supervised approaches for contrastive learning, including systems that use noise contrastive estimation-based loss functions. We will conclude the talk by discussing the recent self-supervised approaches where the need for using a contrastive term is eliminated.</span>-->

#### Deep learning-based musical version identification: Connecting domain knowledge with data-driven systems.
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">F. Yesiler</span>
<!--<br/><span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract**: The version identification (VI) task concerns detecting and retrieving a set of songs that originate
from the same underlying musical composition. For more than a decade, VI systems suffered from the
accuracy-scalability trade-off, but recent years have witnessed an increase in deep learning-based
VI approaches that take a step toward bridging the accuracy-scalability gap.
<br/>In this talk, we will go through deep learning-based VI, starting with a musically-motivated method
called MOVE. I will point out the design decisions and training strategies that facilitate learning
semantically-meaningful embeddings for musical versions. Then, I will introduce two recent works
that further improve upon MOVE regarding two perspectives: (1) the accuracy, by addressing the
limitations of using only chroma features and analyzing the potential accuracy gains resulting from
combining various input representations, and (2) the scalability, by addressing the large embedding
sizes and proposing methods to obtain smaller embeddings while maintaining similar accuracies. I
will conclude the talk by giving some ideas for the future of VI.</span>-->

#### Version Identification in the 20s.
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">F. Yesiler, C. Tralie, and J. Serr√†.</span>
<!--<br/><span style="font-size:0.8em;">**Abstract**: The version identification (VI) task concerns detecting and retrieving a set of songs that originate from the same underlying musical composition. Versions (or cover songs) convey the same musical entity while incorporating differences in several musical characteristics, including the differences in timbre, tempo, key, lyrics, and even added/deleted sections. The main applications include digital rights management and music catalog organization.
<br/>For more than a decade, VI systems suffered from the accuracy-scalability trade-off, with attempts to increase accuracy resulting in cumbersome, non-scalable systems. Recent years however have witnessed an increase in deep learning-based VI approaches that take a step toward bridging the accuracy-scalability gap, and we start seeing the possibility to deploy such systems in real-world applications. Although this trend positively influences the number of researchers and institutions working on VI, it may also result in obscuring the literature before the deep learning era. To appreciate the 20 years of novel ideas in VI and to facilitate building better systems in the next decade, we believe that now may be the right time to review some of the successful ideas and applications proposed in VI literature and connect them to current systems and ideas.
<br/>We will start the tutorial by explaining common input representations and feature post-processing steps. We will continue with comparing the pros and cons of alignment-based and embedding-based approaches, which constitute the two main perspectives for similarity estimation in VI. Lastly, after discussing a number of ideas that can be incorporated into any VI system, we will conclude by presenting the current challenges and future directions in VI research. Our goal is for the audience to leave with a thorough appreciation of both the history of the task and current directions, and that this context will allow them to jump into conducting novel research in the area.</span>-->
